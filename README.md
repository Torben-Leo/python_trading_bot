Implementation of an automated trading algorithm based on sentiment analysis of Reddit and Twitter comments.
The purpose of this project is to build an automated trading alogrithm based on sentiment analysis fo Reddit and Twitter
comments. For this the Twitter and Reddit API's are used as well as a sentiment analysis tool. 
The results are then integrated into different maschine learning algorithms which predict the asset changes based on the
sentiment got from Reddit and Twitter. 
Afterwards Backtesting is conducted to see how the strategies perform. Based on the results from Backtesting one strategy
is chosen and integrated. 
In a next steps the algorithm is connected to a real trading platform over its API to test it with small amounts in the 
market.
