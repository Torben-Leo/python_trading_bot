Implementation of an automated trading algorithm based on sentiment analysis of Reddit and Twitter comments. This project aims to build a computerized trading algorithm based on sentiment analysis for Reddit and Twitter comments. Twitter and Reddit APIs have used sentiment analysis tools. The results are then integrated into different machine learning algorithms which predict the asset changes based on the sentiment got from Reddit and Twitter. Afterward, Backtesting is conducted to see how the strategies perform. Based on the results from Backtesting, one approach is chosen and integrated. The following steps connect the algorithm to a real trading platform over its API to test it with small amounts in the market.
